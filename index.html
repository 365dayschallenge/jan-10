    <h3>CINDY WILLIAMS GUTIÉRREZ “THE SMALL CLAIM OF BONES”</h3>
    <pre>
        <p class="poem">
            what my body knows
            is not a lie it’s not
            a lie i tell you it is not
            it’s nothing short of truth
            and nothing larger
            my past lodges
            in my marrow and if
            i wanted a transplant
            there’d be no match
            others’ sorrows dwarf
            my petty traumas still
            these bones are mine
            when they creak
            when they moan
            when they whine
            there’s only one thing
            i can claim these bones
            are mine i tell you
            they are mine and kind
            to abandon no thing
            that makes this pulse
            no one but me
        </p>
